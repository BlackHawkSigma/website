The most obvious and the best way to judge an open source project is to just look at the code but
this can be kind of tedious and sometimes you don't like what you see there, so an alternative that
we have all naturally developed on our own or have been advised to, is to see how many people have
starred a project, and then pick the one with the most stars.

"For example, React.js has 207K stars compared to Angular's measly 63K stars, so we can conclude
that react.js is a better framework" â€” [Ben Awad](https://youtu.be/MT6M_sqAuZo?t=243)

While the above is a joke (not that React isn't a better frontend framework), It is not a good idea
to judge the quality of an open source project by how many stars does it have.

How many times have you gazed upon an open source project, and wondered fabulously about the
correlation between the number of stars garnered and the actual value of the project?

If it's zero, then ok, you're a better person than me.

But if not, then allow me to introduce you to my recent experiments and research. It's likely that
this will be your first encounter with this bizarre market.

## Buying GitHub Stars

Yep! That's a thing. Just as purchasing Instagram likes is a genuine phenomenon, buying GitHub stars
is equally tangible.

But, I won't just tell you that buying GitHub stars is real, and move on, that would be so
disappointing, right?

So I did it! I have tried 2 platforms, I won't say any names or links, as I would never advocate for
such a thing.

I thought it's gonna be a really interesting experiment (definitely not for my wallet), and a very
educational one, So let's dive into it!

#### Premium Stars

Bear with me, I know what you're thinking: "what the hell?! There are types??!" Yes, there are!

Premium Stars are the kind of stars that are much more expensive, the most legit looking fakes, and
most importantly the ones who have a higher chance of staying over the long-term.

So I put on Incognito mode and started hunting using my second identity "Boogeyman".

![Premium Stars Reciept](/blog-assets/judging-open-source-by-github-stars/premium-stars-reciept.png)

And so it costed me 20 Euros for 25 stars which is â‚¬0.8/star, it's expensive, but I'm gonna show you
how they look like in a minute.

It took 6 hours for my order to complete, and the accounts look really legit, each has profile
picture, a company that he/she works for, a couple of repositories, and a contribution to one or
more open source project, next to being a GitHub member for over a year.

#### Cheap Stars

"Whenever you see premium goods, remember, the bargain bin isn't far behind!" â€” Probably me

While the above works, there are definitely much cheaper ones like this:

![Cheap Stars Reciept](/blog-assets/judging-open-source-by-github-stars/cheap-stars-reciept.png)

Where it costed me 8.19 Euros for 100 stars which is â‚¬0.08/star.

Now what is the difference?

Well, the biggest one is that the accounts were just made at the time of your order, they don't have
any fake personal information nor repositories or contributions.

And after a month, they were all gone. GitHub detected them and banned them.

What's crazy is, you can reach out and they are gonna redo your order for free ðŸ™‚

### Detecting Fake Stars

Then I wondered if there's any tools that can expose those repositories ðŸ¤”

And I discovered [Astronomer](https://github.com/Ullaakut/astronomer), a tool to detect illegitimate
stars from bot accounts on GitHub projects.

It works by fetching data from every GitHub user who starred a common repository and computes how
likely it is that those users are real humans, it works using what they call "Trust algorithm".

Trust is computed based on many different factors:

- The average amount of lifetime contributions among stargazers
- The average amount of private contributions
- The average amount of public created issues
- The average amount of public authored commits
- The average amount of public opened pull requests
- The average amount of public code reviews
- The average weighted contribution score (weighted by making older contributions more trustworthy)
- Every 5th percentile, from 5 to 95, of the weighted contribution score
- The average account age, older is more trustworthy

So, I've tried on 3 different repositories to see the results.

So, that's scary. The premium stars scored pretty decently as a `B`, but the cheap ones scored an
`E` which is the worst, but who knows, maybe there's an ultra premium stars service that's scoring
an `A`.

## Learned Lessons

Don't judge open source by the number of stargazers, because they can easily and quite affordably be
fake. It's like any other social media platform, where fake accounts exist.

Instead, ask coworkers, Twitter, or even open a github issue asking why should you use this project
and not the other ones, I'm sure you can gather pretty good answers from multiple projects proving
what they excel at. Or the best of course is reviewing the code concisely, though I know that
normally on a daily basis, we don't often have the time and energy to do that.

Star legit good open source projects like
[GraphQL Hive](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-hive), it has 200-ish stars, but you're
missing out on an already incredibly successful project, we and you don't need 10K stars to have a
successful open source project.

Well, there you have it. Got some seed money for your next startup? Throw it into building truly
valuable projects. Now that's an investment you won't regret. ðŸ˜‰
